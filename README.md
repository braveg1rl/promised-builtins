# promised-builtins

Promises that somewhat act like the instances of the builtins that are promised. An instance of `PromisedString` acts somewhat like an instance of `String`. An instance of `PromisedArray` acts somewhat like an instance of Array.

All in all, this should be considered a code experiment.

## What are builtins

Builtin is short-hand for built-in object. The ECMAScript 5 specification defines a built-in object as follows:

> built-in object
> object supplied by an ECMAScript implementation, independent of the host environment, that is present at the start of the execution of an ECMAScript program.

[ECMAScript5.1 Spec 4.3.7](http://es5.github.io/#x4.3.6)

I'm only concerned about built-in objects of which one can instantiate an instance through a constructor function. These constructor functions are listed in [ECMAScript 5.1 Spec 15.1.4](http://es5.github.io/#x15.1.4). Moreover, I'll limit myself to `Array`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Number` and `Date`, because these are the most typical kinds of objects one regularly deals with in simple scripting.

`Object` and `Function` are certainly interesting too. I'll attend to them in a later stage.

## Usage

Promised builtins wrap regular [Promise/A+ promises](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec).

```coffee
deferred = Q.defer() # create a deferred with something, anything
promisedString = new PromisedString deferred.promise
```

Promised builtins are promises, so they support the `then` method.

```coffee
promisedString.then (string) -> console.log string
```

Promised builtins act as builtins as much as they can. When you call a method on them, they return another promised builtin. For example:

```coffee
promisedWords = promisedString.split(", ")
promisedWords.then (words) -> console.log word for word in words
```

But also

```coffee
promisedWords.forEach (word) -> console.log word 
```

Here the actual iteration happens only after the value for words has been resolved.
This means that in some cases, promised builtins work exactly like normal builtins, resulting in very clean code.

### Complete example

```coffee
Q = require "q"
{PromisedString} = require "promised-builtins"

getKeywordsField = ->
  deferredKeywordsField = Q.defer()
  setImmediate ->
    deferredKeywordsField.resolve("promises, deferreds, builtins, javascript, asynchronous")
  new PromisedString deferredKeywordsField.promise

# We play dumb and act like this is synchronous code,
# and like the objects in play are actual builtins.
keywordsField = getKeywordsField()
keywords = keywordsField.split ", " # a PromisedArray instance
keywords.forEach (keyword) -> console.log keyword # works
keywordsField = keywords.join "," # a PromisedString instance
keywordsField.then (keywordsField) -> console.log keywordsField # works too
```

## Limitations

* You can't use normal operators on the promised builtins.
* You can't pass the promised builtin as an argument to a function that expects a regular builtin. A function should be specifically adjusted to accept a promised builtin (but this is certainly possible).

Every time you have an accute need for true values, you need to call `promisedValue.then` to get (or rather, wait for) the true value. But in some cases, you may be able to do without. That is, until your (logical) algorithm has finished, and you want to output something.
